# SBSPS-Challenge-5230-Super-Predictor-of-Indian-Premier-League-IPL-
## We did Exploratory Analysis on Indian Premier League Dataset, and extracted the important features from it.
## It was made in Jupyter Notebook and also separately as Python Script. The files are in


# Using this extracted data file, we created a dashboard

# Experimental Investigations
While analysiing the solution for this problem we have found some unwanted and some 
duplicate data that need to  be processed in a manner such that to get a accurate results. 
So, that we have removed some unwanted data also merged the duplicate data. In our 
project there are such constratints which can affect the analysis such as
