## We did Exploratory Data Analysis on [Indian Premier League Dataset](https://github.com/smartinternz02/SBSPS-Challenge-5230-Super-Predictor-of-Indian-Premier-League-IPL-/blob/master/matches-DATASET.csv), and extracted the important features from it.

# Using this extracted data file, we visualized the features and created a Dashboard

# Experimental Investigations
<div style="font-size:25px;">While analysiing the solution for this problem we have found some unwanted and some 
duplicate data that need to  be processed in a manner such that to get a accurate results. 
So, that we have removed some unwanted data also merged the duplicate data. In our 
project there are such constratints which can affect the analysis such as</div>

* There are some IPL Teams which changes their name at some seasons Eg: Delhi Daredevils, Royal Challengers Banglore, Sunrises Hyderabad etc... 
* There are some new IPL Teams which played for only few ipl seasons Eg: Kochi Tuskers 
Kerala etc.. 
* There is also teams like Pune Warriors played for some season. 
* There is also some teams like chennai and Rajasthan got banned for couple of years. 
* There evolved a 2 teams Gujarat Lions and  Rising Pune Spergiants which was  replacing 
the Chennai and Rajasthan.  -->
