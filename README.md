# SBSPS-Challenge-5230-Super-Predictor-of-Indian-Premier-League-IPL-
## We did Exploratory Analysis on Indian Premier League Dataset, and extracted the important features from it.
## It was made in Jupyter Notebook and also separately as Python Script. The files are in

```
ğŸ“¦source 
 â”£ ğŸ“œIPL_objectives.ipynb 
 â”— ğŸ“œIPL_objectives.py
 ```

### Before running script make sure that all modules are installed. Use either jupyter notebook or directly run it as python file.

## All the Extracted features and datas are saved as csv file in output directory
```
